<p><center> It's a great hobby. <br> You have to have hobbies to keep your hands busy or you'll get bored. <p> One of my hobbies is baking during my leisure time. <br> When I bake, it feels like the whole world is mine. I love learning about new techniques in baking, ingredients and the whole new ideas in baking. Baking is like super therapeutic to me. </p>

Baking was my way of relaxing. I loved the smile and peopleâ€™s faces when they taste my cake, and it gave me a strong push to come up with something better. I loved the compliments I get from mum and dad anytime I bake something extraordinary. <br> They were proud I found something I love and could keep to it. </p>

<p><center><font size="5"> My other hobbies is I love to learning music instrumentals. I'm learn to play it by myself, online larning is a fantastic option. <br> For example, I will learning or refer frrom the youtube tutorial. <br> Music instrumentals that I've learn such as piano, ukulele and currently kalimba. <br> I'm just a beginner that learn the basic things from these music instrumentals. <br> To be honestly, I  felt so excited to learn a new thing and keep practising day by days until it's smooth and without looking at the chord.
